## Setup

This project uses the Flutter SDK and Flutter Version Management tool(a.k.a FVM). If you do not have any idea how to install these tools you can check them out in the [Flutter - Get Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and [FVM - Getting Started](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/overview). 

With these tools installed locally you can run the `fvm flutter pub get` command to fetch the dependencies.
